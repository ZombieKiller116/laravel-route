# laravel-route
this repository contains two files that will be used to configure adequate routing without public

when starting a project on laravel, there is a problem with the presence of public in the path. file .htaccess configures apache to redirect to the desired directory. also, to avoid duplicating the public path(localhost/public and localhost), I changed RouteProvider
